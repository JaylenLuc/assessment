# Setup

* Python version doesn't really matter, we use 3.11
* Please use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (sort of setup in main.py) and the [OpenAI library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)

There is an example .env file named .env.example whereof you insert your openAI API secret key
